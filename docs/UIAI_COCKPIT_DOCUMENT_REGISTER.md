# UIAI Cockpit Numbered Document Register

**Register ID:** `UIAI-COCKPIT-REGISTER`  
**Status:** Active document-family index  
**Repository:** `WPUIAI/uiai-engine`

## 0. Purpose

This register provides stable, sortable identifiers for the UIAI Cockpit master specification, integrated decisions, amendments, and machine-readable companions. It does not replace the authority or version metadata inside each document.

## 1. Numbering rules

```text
UIAI-COCKPIT-000
  Master Cockpit specification.

UIAI-COCKPIT-001, 002, 003...
  Integrated decisions and normative amendments in adoption order.

UIAI-COCKPIT-002-C01, C02...
  Machine-readable companions belonging to a numbered decision/amendment.

UIAI-COCKPIT-002/AFB-001
  Fully qualified stable requirement identifier inside Amendment 002.
```

Rules:

1. Document numbers never change when a title or filename is refined.
2. A replacement master revision remains `000` and changes its document version.
3. Amendments increment monotonically and are never renumbered to close gaps.
4. Machine-readable companions inherit the parent number and increment `C01`, `C02`, and so on.
5. Local requirement IDs remain readable; external references SHOULD use the fully qualified form.
6. Accepted amendments govern their explicit subject until incorporated into a later approved master revision.

| `UIAI-COCKPIT-001` | [`UIAI_COCKPIT_001_INTERACTIVE_REPORTS_INTEGRATION_DECISION_2026-07-16.md`](UIAI_COCKPIT_001_INTERACTIVE_REPORTS_INTEGRATION_DECISION_2026-07-16.md) | Integrated decision | Review Reports and Report Canvas conformance decision |

## 3. Application order

```text
UIAI-COCKPIT-000 master
→ accepted numbered decisions and amendments in ascending order
→ machine-readable companions for implementation and proof
→ generated contracts, tasks, tests, Evidence, Receipts, and release proof
```

A machine-readable companion must agree with its normative parent. A discrepancy blocks implementation until the parent or companion is corrected explicitly.
